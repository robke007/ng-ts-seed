#ng-ts-seed

Angular seed project templates for web apps and components, using Typescript.

This repository contains 2 seed projects. One for a full application, and one for an angular component.

##getting started:
We need to install all npm and bower dependencies:
```sh
npm update
bower update
```
 
We need to build the project:
```sh
grunt build
```

Open build/index.html inside a browser and you should see the application running.
